To use the this XHtml compliant version of the YiiDebugToolbar, install it as usual.
Then make sure your main layout ends like this:

```<?php if(!defined('YII_DEBUG')) { echo '</body>'; echo '</html>'; }?>```

So in debug mode, it will not output </body></html>.  This is done by YiiDebugToolbar now.

Known issues:

The SQL window appears to be not initialized 100% correctly.
